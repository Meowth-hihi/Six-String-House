            <h2>Introducing the Cory Beaulieu Signature Jackson King V</h2>
            <p class="description">The 20th anniversary of Ascendency marks a major moment for Trivium fans and an even bigger one for guitarists. Corey Beaulieu’s brand-new Jackson Signature King V arrives as the refined evolution of the very guitar that defined his early career.</p>

            <p>Whether you’re chasing Trivium’s ferocious tones or simply looking for a high-performance metal machine, this is a guitar built to inspire.</p>

            <h3>From Ascendency to Today</h3>
            <p>Corey’s relationship with the King V started back in the Ascendency album cycle, when he got his first Jackson Flying V what he still calls his “dream guitar.” Every signature model since has been shaped by that original instrument, and this new release is the most refined expression yet.</p>

            <h3>What’s New?</h3>
            <p>Over the years, Corey learned what worked, what didn’t, and what could be improved. This new signature model incorporates all of it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Unfinished neck for a smoother, faster feel</li>
                <li>Updated pickup configuration developed through years of testing</li>
                <li>Refined specs to match his evolved playing style</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This isn’t a reissue, it’s the evolution of a classic.</p>

            <h3>Featuring Corey’s Own Signature Pickup: The Seymour Duncan “Damocles”</h3>
            <p>One of the biggest upgrades to this model is the addition of Corey’s own signature active pickups: the Seymour Duncan Blackout “Damocles.”</p>
            <p>Developed between his Winter Storm guitar and this new release, the Damocles pickup was designed to meet the demands of Trivium’s shifting tunings and high-output sound.</p>

            <h3>Why the Damocles Stands Out:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Engineered for both 6- and 7-string guitars</li>
                <li>EQ’d to Corey’s exact preferences</li>
                <li>Delivers clarity, punch, and consistency across tunings, from low B to drop D</li>
                <li>Ideal for both aggressive riffing and articulate lead work</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It’s one of the most versatile high-gain pickups in the active world, and it’s finally embedded in his signature King V.</p>

            <h3>Available in Both 6 and 7-String Models</h3>
            <p>Since Trivium plays both 6 and 7-string guitars on their albums and live shows, Corey wanted fans to have access to both options. That tradition continues here. Whether you’re a classic 6-string player or a low-end explorer, the King V lineup has you covered.</p>

            <h3>A Stunning New Aesthetic</h3>
            <p>This version debuts a new look with its charcoal black burst finish, sleek, dark, and stage-ready. It’s an eye-catching design worthy of the Ascendency 20th Anniversary Tour.</p>

            <h3>Road-Tested and Tour-Approved</h3>
            <p>Corey has already road-tested the guitar across Trivium’s entire Ascendency Anniversary Tour in Europe and North America.</p>
            <p>The results? Rock-solid reliability.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>70-minute set</li>
                <li>One tuning</li>
                <li>Never had to retune once</li>
                <li>Zero issues night after night</li>
            </ul>
            <p>According to Corey, this thing is “very durable on the road” a seal of approval any guitarist can appreciate.</p>

            <h3>Built to Inspire the Next Generation</h3>
            <p>Find the guitar that visually inspires you.</p>
            <p>That’s what a Jackson Flying V did for Corey, and his hope is that this new model sparks that same excitement for upcoming players, whether you’re just starting or adding another weapon to your arsenal.</p>
            <p>With its effortless playability, powerful pickups, and undeniable stage presence, the Signature King V practically begs you to start riffing the moment you pick it up.</p>

            <h3>Get Your Pro Series Signature Corey Beaulieu King V</h3>
            <p>If you’re ready to level up your rig with a guitar built on two decades of innovation, durability, and metal history, the Jackson Pro Series Signature Corey Beaulieu King V is the ultimate choice.</p>
            <p>It’s more than a tribute, it’s a modern high-performance instrument built to meet the demands of today’s players.</p>
